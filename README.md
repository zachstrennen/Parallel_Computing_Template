# Parallel_Computing_Template

This repository contains a python template for parallel computing and assessing its speed. This template is loosely based off a coding assignment I was given when I was completing my master's degree at CMU. The packages required to run this code are multiprocessing and matplotlib.pyplot. Below, I will give a breakdown of the two included files and the data directory.

## `parallel_computed_factorization.py`

## `trial_division.py`

## `data`
